        <p><strong>What is NLP?</strong></p>
        <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The ultimate goal of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and respond to human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful. This involves a variety of tasks such as text analysis, translation, sentiment analysis, and speech recognition.</p>
