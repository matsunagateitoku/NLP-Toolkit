        <p>This page provides help and instructions for the NLP Tools application.</p>
        
        <p>Welcome to the NLP Tools application help page. Here you will find information on how to use the various tools available for natural language processing tasks. These tools are designed to help you analyze and process text data efficiently.</p>
        
        <p><strong>POS Tagging:</strong> The Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging tool allows you to tag words in a sentence with their respective parts of speech. Simply enter a sentence and the tool will output each word along with its POS tag. This is useful for understanding the grammatical structure of a sentence.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Wordcloud:</strong> The Wordcloud tool generates a visual representation of the most frequent words in a text dataset. You can upload a text file or paste text directly into the input box. The tool will create a word cloud where the size of each word indicates its frequency. This is useful for quickly identifying key themes and topics in your text data.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Semantic Parse:</strong> The Semantic Parse tool helps you understand the meaning of a sentence by breaking it down into its semantic components. Enter a sentence and the tool will analyze the structure and provide a detailed parse. This is useful for tasks that require deep understanding of sentence meaning.</p>
        
        <p><strong>NER:</strong> The Named Entity Recognition (NER) tool identifies and classifies named entities in a sentence. Enter a sentence and the tool will highlight entities such as names, locations, and dates. This is useful for extracting important information from text data.</p>
        
        <p>If you have any questions or need further assistance, please refer to the documentation or contact our support team. We hope you find the NLP Tools application helpful for your text processing needs.</p>
